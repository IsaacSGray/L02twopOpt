        "**SUMMARY**: A brief summary description of the design and implementation, including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. This should be no more than two paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "I started with the extraction method, then a list of places method. Both were important to my design process, as they give me my data to workwith. My design with the extraction of the data I devised after some lab hours with nakazawa and research with splicing of list in python, and some stack overflow on maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that I started with setting up my coordinate data in self.coords. I loop over self.nodedata which contains everything from its ID and all other important data. With some research into accessing specific elements to refresh myself on my python, I get it working. Accessing and appending each nods x and y coordinate. Useful for calculating distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is what I did next. To calculate the distance of the route was quite useful as it lets us later implement a method where we need to find the nearest city. I did some stackoverflow search on calculating distance with networkx graphs, plus some gernative AI make this formula I used easier for me to understand move on my development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geroute was the hardest part of development given with how many variables and just keeping track of when and where we are in the route. I started by checking if there are places to visit, then while there are places to check, clean up the list of places visited, and check if its not in visited. I used a fancy lil trick gathered from stack overflow and also generativeAI on using the min function with a lamda expression. It was confusing and took some debugging with syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "I designed getGreedy last by simply calling the route function and appending the starting city to our route.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PERSONNEL**: Met with nakazawa at the start, consulted generative AI, stack overflow, and W3schools on anything else that didn't make sense to me. Some questions I had were also answered by peers in the course (those who had more recent python experience than I)\n",
        "\n",
        "**CHALLENGES**: What was the most challenging was the datastructures, some nuance python functions, and just *how* to imagine the graph. A huge issue I have is needing to conceptualize, visualize, and solve the problem conceptually before I can do it. I spent a lot of time on the drawing board before I put a single character in a line of code. Another issue was the link not working. It was sort of a mega headache. After I got past that at that it was a bit smooth other than trying to read the list- which was an issue since it was spaced out, unformatted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge was how to go about calculating distance, plus how to find the nearest city- that was a massive freaking headache for me as I didnt quite have my route yet, so calculation from current node was hard for me to conceptualize- so it held me back for a while.\n",
        "\n",
        "**INNOVATIONS**: I did not make any fancy or new innovations that were not asked of me. I did was necessary to complete the document. The most 'innovative' was fixing the URL document, and the calculate distance plus min methods used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TESTING**: I tested things block by block, solving the smaller problems at first and testing them- and the bigger problems that had bigger collateral to debugging and testing I tested last as they often relied on directly or indirectly the smaller methods\n",
        "\n",
        "**ERRORS**: URL not working properly, that was frustrating as heck.\n",
        "\n",
        "**COMMENTS**: This was a pain in my butt- but that was due to me being crazy sick at the time of development and me solving the problem. I took an incremental approach to design and development and that really helped me. A huge comment I'd have to make is just how much help nakazawa was at the start with resolving thie mystical link not working properly. Another great help was generative AI which helped me with some niche python functions and methods that I was unfamiliar with.\n",
        "\n",
        "I absolutely abhor networkx due to its documentation being a bit..cluttered and confusing- and with research- also outdated.\n",
