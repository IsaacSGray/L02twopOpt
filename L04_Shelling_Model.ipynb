        "**SUMMARY**: My initial design evolved quite drastically. Originally I wanted to do networkX, however with some experimenting and some asking around, matplotlib was much easier to use which has coloring functionality, plus we also have X,Y coordinates which we are able to 'swap' Around based on checks. We can also color agents based on values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**PERSONNEL**: I worked with the TA, discussing some ideas, stub testing, also helping the TA in turn understanding the project requirement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**CHALLENGES**: Descriptions of the largest challenges you overcame and what made them challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the biggest challenges that faced me was testing this thing- it was hard to test it in small chunks considering that test firing one part at a time and seeing how it interacted with one another was hard to conceptualize. I did some doodling on whiteboard and paper to help find bounding\n",
        "\n",
        "**INNOVATIONS**:I didn't do any extra innovations not required by the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TESTING**: First as I developed my init function developing the data I need to keep persistent and eventually print at the end  of runtime as required by the lab document. Now after that I built development of my grid, and then devved and tested my checking of each node is satisfied, neighbors, and then swaps, then running until completion.\n",

        "**ERRORS**: A list in bulleted form of all known errors and deficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Order of growth of his class is incredibly bad. I mean, anything about 60x50 ends up taking much longer  time to get a single grid.\n",

        "\n",
        "The lab was interesting, however given how tight the last month of all the due dates will be in this last month- its rough. I felt crunched by this project atop my capstone and HCC project, plus my calculus exam study period, plus the final exam for this course."
